# Introduction 

--------------------------------------

Hello everyone!! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ <br /> 
In this blog, I will talk about one of the most popular ORM frameworks in the Java ecosystem, which is Hibernate, but I will mainly focus on the architecture of this framework, the core components, and their functionalities.<br /> 
So let's started.<br />

> ðŸ’¡ ORM or object-relational mapping is the programming technique to map application domain model objects to the relational database tables.

# What is JPA?

After talking about Hibernate, we need first to understand the **JPA**.<br />
**JPA** or **Java Persistence API** is a standard for mapping Java objects to relational databases, which means that each object is represented as a table in the database, in other words, the Java objects can outlive outside the Java application and the **JPA** specification lets you define which objects should be persisted, and how those objects should be persisted in your Java applications, as well as via the **JPA** the developer can map, store, update, and retrieve data from relational databases to Java objects and vice versa.<br />

> ðŸ’¡ **JPA** specifications are defined with annotations in `javax.presistence package`.

Whereas we have some problems here because the **JPA** is just a specification, meaning there is no implementation. You can annotate your classes as much as you would like with **JPA annotations**, however, without implementation, nothing will happen.<br />
We can think that **JPA** is an interface but in order to work with, we need an implementation.

# JPA implementations (Hibernate)

As you can see, in the section above we found out a problem which is the implementation of **JPA**, but don't worry **JPA** has many implementations the most of them is **Hibernate framework** in there are others like **EclipseLink** and **Apache OpenJPA**.<br />

So, from everything we've seen, we can define **Hibernate** as **Java-based ORM tool** that provides a framework for mapping application domain objects to the relational database tables and vice versa, moreover by Hibernate we can manipulate data from relational databases to Java objects without working with the **SQL** because Hibernate contains predefined methods for creating, updating, deleting, inserting objects from and to database tables.

# Hibernate architecture

As you can see in the picture **Hibernate** holds several components. In this section I will try to clarify each component and his role:<br />

**Configuration object:** `org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration` is a predefined class which holds configuration properties of **Hibernate**, it's created first when creating the Hibernate application, it has two components: 
   * Database connection which provides the configuration for the connection.
   * The class mapping setup which creates the connection between the java class and the database.


**SessionFactory object:**  It is instantiated by the `Configuration` Object, it's a factory of Session and client of `ConnectionProvider`. It holds second-level cache (optional) of data.<br />
The `org.hibernate.SessionFactory` interface provides factory methods to create objects of Session.

> ðŸ‘‰ Note: We can have one `SessionFactory` per database, so if we want to work with multiple databases, we need multiple `SessionFactory` and for each SessionFactory a configuration file.


**Session object:** It is considered as an interface between the data stored in the database and the application. It is a short-lived object that wraps the **JDBC connection** also it's a factory of `Transaction`, `Query`, and `Criteria` as well as the `org.hibernate.Session` interface provides methods to insert, update, and delete the objects. It holds the first-level cache (mandatory) of data.
