# Introduction 

--------------------------------------

Hello everyone, in this article I will discuss the Spring web MVC, the components of this framework, their roles, the architecture as well as the request execution flow in Spring MVC application.
So please enjoy reading!

# Spring MVC components

The Spring Web MVC framework provides Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and a lot of ready components that can be used to develop Web applications.
In this section, we will focus mainly on the components:

## 1-Front controller

The front controller is responsible to perform pre-processing and post-processing of incoming requests.<br />
For example: <br />
* **pre-processing request:** capturing form data incoming from the client.
* **post-processing request:** retrieving data to client.<br />

In Spring Web  MVC based application we will use the `DispatcherServlet` as a front controller which is a pre-defined servlet provided by the Spring MVC module. <br />

>üí°Java Servlet are programs that act as a middle layer between a request coming from a Web browser or HTTP client, and applications on the HTTP server.

## 2.Handler mapper

The handler mapper is a pre-defined class available in Spring MVC which is responsible to identify the request handler (controller) and return details to the `DispatcherServlet`.

## 3.Controller
A controller is a class  which is responsible to handle the request, there are some pre-defined controllers available in the Spring MVC like below: <br />
* `org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.SimpleFormController`
* `org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.AbstractFormController`
* `org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.multiaction.MultiActionControllerr` etc...<br />

Also, we can define our costume controllers using the `@Controller` annotation.

## 4.Model and View

Once the request processing is completed the controller will return the `org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView` object to the `DispatcherServlet`.<br />

The **model** holds data retrieved from the data source. <br />
The **view** represents a logical view name.

## 5.View resolvers

In Spring MVC we have multiple view resolver classes that implement the interface `org.springframework.web.servlet.ViewResolver` :<br />
* `org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver`
* `org.springframework.web.servlet.view.UrlBasedViewResolver` etc...<br />

These view resolvers are responsible to identify view files (location and extension).

## 6.View component

Responsible to render model data on view files.<br />

>üí° All the above-mentioned components (i.e. HandlerMapping, Controller, and ViewResolver) are parts of WebApplicationContext, which is an extension of the ApplicationContext with some extra features necessary for web applications.


# Request execution flow

<img src="/assets/img/sample/request-execution-flow.png" alt="drawing" width="350" height="350"/>

The Spring Web MVC framework is designed around the `DispatcherServlet`.

üîç What happens behind the scene when an HTTP request is sent to the server. <br />

1. Incoming Http request will be received by the Dispatcher servlet, which will send request URL to the HandlerMapper.
2. HandlerMapper will identify the appropriate request handler (controller) which is responsible to handle the request. After the HandlerMapper will send handler request details to DispatcherServlet.
