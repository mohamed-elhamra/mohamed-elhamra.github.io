# What is DI ?

Hello audience, today I am going to discuss the spring dependency injection which is a design pattern used to implement the IoC in the [**Spring container**](https://www.mohamed-elhamra.me/posts/ioc-container-in-spring-framework/).<br />

Before talking about the implementation of this mechanism, I need first to define the dependency injection:<br />

> In software engineering, **dependency injection** is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on. These other objects are called dependencies.

Thatâ€™s the [**Wikipedia definition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection), I know that's not enough to understand, 
but I will give you an example to illustrate more this mechanism.
